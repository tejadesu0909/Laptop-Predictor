Questions to Explore:
•	Which features have the most significant impact on laptop prices?
•	Can the model accurately predict the prices of laptops from lesser-known brands?
•	Does the brand of the laptop significantly influence its price?
•	How well does the model perform on laptops with high-end specifications compared to budget laptops?
•	What are the limitations and challenges in predicting laptop prices accurately?
•	How does the model perform when predicting the prices of newly released laptops not present in the training dataset?
 
Project start:
There are several columns which are needed to be split, for e.x…, 
 ScreenResolution:
•	The 'ScreenResolution' column contains information about screen resolution, but it might be more useful to split this into separate columns for resolution width and height. This will facilitate further analysis and modeling.
Cpu:
•	The 'Cpu' column contains information about the processor, including the brand and clock speed. It might be beneficial to split this column into separate columns for the processor brand and clock speed for better feature engineering.
Memory:
•	The 'Memory' column contains information about the laptop's storage capacity. It might be helpful to split this column into separate columns for storage type (SSD, HDD) and capacity (in GB).
Increasing the count of features through splitting columns can have both advantages and disadvantages, and whether it's a good practice depends on various factors:
Advantages:
1.	Improved Model Performance: Splitting merged columns into multiple features can provide the model with more granular information, potentially leading to better performance.
2.	Enhanced Feature Representation: By breaking down merged columns, you can capture more nuanced relationships between features and the target variable, leading to more accurate predictions.
3.	Better Interpretability: Having more specific features can make it easier to interpret the model's predictions and understand which factors are driving those predictions.
Disadvantages:
1.	Curse of Dimensionality: Increasing the number of features can lead to a high-dimensional feature space, which can make the model more complex and computationally intensive. This is especially problematic with limited data.
2.	Increased Risk of Overfitting: With a larger number of features, there's a higher risk of overfitting, where the model learns to memorize the training data rather than generalize to unseen data.
3.	Data Sparsity: If certain features have a large number of categories or values, it can result in sparse data, making it challenging for the model to learn meaningful patterns.
4.	Model Complexity: More features can increase the complexity of the model, making it harder to understand and maintain.
In summary, while splitting merged columns can provide additional information to the model and potentially improve performance, it's essential to strike a balance between feature richness and model complexity. Careful consideration should be given to the dataset size, model complexity, and the potential trade-offs between interpretability and performance. Additionally, techniques like feature selection and dimensionality reduction can help manage the number of features and mitigate the risks associated with high dimensionality.
